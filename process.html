        <h1>Process</h1>
      
        <p>Eleven events occur concurrently during baking, some of which (such as starch gelatinization) would not occur at room temperature.</p>
  
<ol>
<li>Fats melt;</li>
<li>Gases form and expand</li>
<li>Microorganisms die</li>
<li>Sugar dissolves</li>
<li>Egg, milk, and gluten proteins coagulate</li>
<li>Starches gelatinize or solidify</li>
<li>Liquids evaporate</li>
<li>Caramelization and Maillard browning occur on crust</li>
<li>Enzymes are inactivated</li>
<li>Changes occur to nutrients</li>
<li>Pectin breaks down.</li>
</ol>

<p>The dry heat of baking changes the form of starches in the food and causes its outer surfaces to brown, giving it an attractive appearance and taste. The browning is caused by caramelization of sugars and the Maillard reaction. Maillard browning occurs when "sugars break down in the presence of proteins". Because foods contain many different types of sugars and proteins, Maillard browning contributes to the flavour of a wide range of foods, including nuts, roast beef and baked bread." The moisture is never entirely "sealed in"; over time, an item being baked will become dry. This is often an advantage, especially in situations where drying is the desired outcome, like drying herbs or roasting certain types of vegetables.</p>

<p>The baking process does not require any fat to be used to cook in an oven. When baking, consideration must be given to the amount of fat that is contained in the food item. Higher levels of fat such as margarine, butter, lard, or vegetable shortening will cause an item to spread out during the baking process.</p>

<p>With the passage of time, breads harden and become stale. This is not primarily due to moisture being lost from the baked products, but more a reorganization of the way in which the water and starch are associated over time. This process is similar to recrystallization and is promoted by storage at cool temperatures, such as in a domestic refrigerator or freezer.</p>
